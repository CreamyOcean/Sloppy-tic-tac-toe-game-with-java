# Sloppy-tic-tac-toe-game-with-java
Kind of a crappy tic-tac-toe game I whipped up in a few hours; messy code with no comments for good readability. Sorry to the fellow software devs reading this lmfao

Some file addresses have to be changed in case you are planning on copying the code to test it.

Made this for no reason; same idea behind uploading it here.
